To bypass SSL use SSLStrip tool made by Moxie Mar. But it does not work on browsers that support HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

Alternative of SSLStrip
1. Start packet sniffer
2. Start ARP Spoofer 
3. Run-> bettercap -iface eth0 -caplet hstshijack/hstshijack
4. Clear browsing histroy
