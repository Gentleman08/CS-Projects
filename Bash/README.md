As a cybersecurity student, shell scripting can be a powerful tool for automating tasks, scanning networks, and securing systems. Here are some project ideas you can develop:

1. Log Analyzer for Suspicious Activity
ðŸ“Œ Description:

A script that scans system logs (/var/log/auth.log, /var/log/syslog, etc.) for suspicious activity such as failed login attempts, unauthorized access, or brute-force attacks.
It can alert administrators via email or display reports.
ðŸ“œ Key Features:

Extract login failures and unauthorized SSH access.
Generate a summary report.
Email notifications for critical alerts.
ðŸ“Œ Commands Used: grep, awk, sed, mail, cat, tail

2. Automated Backup and Encryption Script
ðŸ“Œ Description:

A script to automatically back up important files, encrypt them using gpg, and store them securely.
It can run as a cron job to ensure regular backups.
ðŸ“œ Key Features:

Select specific directories for backup.
Encrypt using GPG (GNU Privacy Guard).
Upload to a cloud service or external drive.
ðŸ“Œ Commands Used: tar, gzip, gpg, scp, rsync, cron

3. Network Port Scanner
ðŸ“Œ Description:

A lightweight port scanner that detects open ports on a given target IP or range.
Helps in ethical hacking and network auditing.
ðŸ“œ Key Features:

Scan a range of IPs or specific hosts.
Check for open ports and running services.
Generate a detailed report.
ðŸ“Œ Commands Used: nc, nmap, awk, grep, netstat, ss

4. Brute Force Attack Prevention Script
ðŸ“Œ Description:

A script that monitors login attempts and blocks IPs that show signs of brute-force attacks.
ðŸ“œ Key Features:

Monitor /var/log/auth.log for failed login attempts.
Block IPs using iptables or fail2ban.
Send alerts when blocking occurs.
ðŸ“Œ Commands Used: grep, awk, sed, iptables, fail2ban, mail

5. Malware Detection Script
ðŸ“Œ Description:

A script that scans files for potential malware signatures based on a predefined list.
ðŸ“œ Key Features:

Compare system files with a list of known malware hashes.
Alert the user if a match is found.
Optionally quarantine or delete infected files.
ðŸ“Œ Commands Used: md5sum, sha256sum, find, grep, awk

6. Packet Sniffer Using Tcpdump
ðŸ“Œ Description:

A script that captures network traffic using tcpdump and filters out important information like HTTP requests, login attempts, or suspicious packets.
ðŸ“œ Key Features:

Capture and log specific packet data.
Analyze DNS queries, HTTP requests, or FTP credentials.
Option to export logs in a readable format.
ðŸ“Œ Commands Used: tcpdump, grep, awk, cut, sort, uniq

7. File Integrity Monitoring System
ðŸ“Œ Description:

A script that checks file integrity by comparing current checksums with stored ones to detect tampering.
ðŸ“œ Key Features:

Monitor changes in critical system files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, etc.).
Store original hashes and compare periodically.
Send alerts when modifications are detected.
ðŸ“Œ Commands Used: md5sum, sha256sum, find, diff, mail

8. Automated Firewall Configuration
ðŸ“Œ Description:

A script that sets up basic firewall rules using iptables or ufw to secure a server.
ðŸ“œ Key Features:

Allow or block specific IP ranges.
Enable logging for suspicious activities.
Configure rules for SSH, HTTP, and FTP services.
ðŸ“Œ Commands Used: iptables, ufw, grep, sed, awk

9. Secure File Shredder
ðŸ“Œ Description:

A script to securely delete files by overwriting them multiple times to prevent recovery.
ðŸ“œ Key Features:

Allow users to select files or directories to delete.
Overwrite data multiple times before deletion.
Option to delete logs securely.
ðŸ“Œ Commands Used: shred, rm, find, stat

10. SSH Login Notification Script
ðŸ“Œ Description:

A script that notifies the admin via email or SMS whenever someone logs into the system using SSH.
ðŸ“œ Key Features:

Monitor /var/log/auth.log for new SSH logins.
Send real-time alerts with login details.
Log all SSH logins for auditing.
ðŸ“Œ Commands Used: grep, awk, mail, logger, crontab

Bonus: Honeypot for Detecting Unauthorized Access
ðŸ“Œ Description:

A simple honeypot that logs unauthorized access attempts and tricks attackers into revealing their methods.
ðŸ“œ Key Features:

Simulates an open SSH service or fake admin panel.
Logs keystrokes and actions of attackers.
Sends real-time alerts when accessed.
ðŸ“Œ Commands Used: netcat, tcpdump, awk, iptables, logger
